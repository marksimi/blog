Writing the first post feels too big.

I feel the need to write something profound both for myself (“you’ve waited all this time; make it amazing”) and the imaginary audience who’s sitting around waiting to pass judgement on this magnificent post.

I used to feel this same resistance to releasing my DJ sets.  “Shit — what will they think of this mix?  This TRACK???”  A&R scouts will tell stories of my clunky transitions.

I’m expecting that this feeling may never fully go away.  But maybe I’ll get better at putting a name to it.  And showing up.

Let’s see.
